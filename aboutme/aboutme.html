 <h2>Ayu Purnomo</h2>
 <p>Hi all, my name is Ayu Purnomo. I live in Rochester, NH with my husband and my son. I'm a working mom and I love spending my free time with my family and my dog. I've been member of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints since 2002.</p>
 <p>I'm pursuing Bachelor Degree in CIT in a hope that once I completed this course, I can apply to Web Design field or any coding related. The things I love the most from BYU-Idaho are learn and teach by gospel, flexibilty and affordable tuition.</p>
 <p>I love traveling, especially to the place that I've never visit before. I also love to try and eat new food. I'm looking forward to getting to know all of you and work together.</p>
